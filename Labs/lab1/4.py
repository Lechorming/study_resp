# Practice 4
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
# write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
new = []
for item in a:
    if item in b:
        new.append(item)

print("List a:" + str(a))
print("List b:" + str(b))
print("Common:" + str(new))
